## Overview

ViGOS is a release-oriented training and evaluation package for visually grounded on-policy self-distillation of multimodal large language models. The released code supports LoRA post-training and evaluation for Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL style checkpoints. The paper experiments use Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct.

Vanilla multimodal OPSD can leak the privileged reference answer into dense token supervision before the student has grounded its response in the image. ViGOS changes the supervision path: the student first writes a visual description, then reasons, then gives a boxed final answer.

## Released Checkpoints

HuggingFace model repositories are reserved at the following placeholders:

| Model | Download | Base model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ViGOS-3B | [OedoSoldier/ViGOS-3B](https://huggingface.co/OedoSoldier/ViGOS-3B) | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct` |
| ViGOS-7B | [OedoSoldier/ViGOS-7B](https://huggingface.co/OedoSoldier/ViGOS-7B) | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` |

Once public, the checkpoints can be used directly for evaluation:

```bash
MODEL_PATH=OedoSoldier/ViGOS-3B bash scripts/eval_vigos.sh
MODEL_PATH=OedoSoldier/ViGOS-7B bash scripts/eval_vigos.sh
```

Or downloaded locally:

```bash
huggingface-cli download OedoSoldier/ViGOS-3B --local-dir checkpoints/ViGOS-3B
huggingface-cli download OedoSoldier/ViGOS-7B --local-dir checkpoints/ViGOS-7B
```

## Method

The student output format is:

```text
<description> image description here </description>
<think> reasoning process here </think>
\boxed{FINAL ANSWER here}
```

ViGOS uses three teacher roles during training:

| Component | Context | Supervised tokens | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Perception teacher | image only | description span | Ground visual claims in the image. |
| Reasoning teacher | image, question, reference answer | reasoning + answer spans | Guide answer-conditioned reasoning after visual evidence exists. |
| Reference teacher | privileged full prompt | invalid rollout tokens only | Recover malformed output format with reverse KL. |

At inference time, all teachers and reference answers are discarded. The final model receives only the image, the question, and the ViGOS student prompt.

## Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OedoSoldier/ViGOS.git
cd ViGOS
uv sync --python 3.11
```

The pinned environment includes PyTorch 2.8.0, Transformers 4.57.1, TRL 0.26.0, PEFT 0.17.1, Accelerate 1.11.0, DeepSpeed 0.18.2, and vLLM 0.11.0. Paper training used 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with bf16 and ZeRO-2.

If a HuggingFace dataset or model is gated:

```bash
uv run huggingface-cli login
```

## Data

Training uses the Vision-SR1-47K dataset on HuggingFace:

```bash
export DATASET_NAME=LMMs-Lab-Turtle/Vision-SR1-47K
export DATASET_SPLIT=train
```

Dataset link: [LMMs-Lab-Turtle/Vision-SR1-47K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LMMs-Lab-Turtle/Vision-SR1-47K)

The HuggingFace dataset card reports the default subset with 47.6k training rows and Apache-2.0 license. The fields used by this release are:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `problem` | yes | Question or instruction text. |
| `images` | yes | PIL-compatible image field. |
| `answer` | yes | Reference answer used by the default privileged teacher prompt. |
| `problem_id` | optional | Numeric id used for logging. |

Other dataset fields such as `solution`, `options`, `path`, and `data_source` may be present but are not required by the default shell scripts.

Tiny or invalid images can be filtered at load time:

```bash
FILTER_TINY_IMAGES=true MIN_IMAGE_SIZE=3 \
DATASET_NAME=LMMs-Lab-Turtle/Vision-SR1-47K \
bash scripts/train_vigos_qwen25_3b.sh
```

## Training

The shell launchers use Accelerate + DeepSpeed with `configs/accelerate_zero2_lora_gpu_8.yaml`.

Training curves and run logs are available in the [W&B Training Logs of ViGOS](https://wandb.ai/oedosoldier-ucas/ViGOS/reports/Training-Logs-of-ViGOS--VmlldzoxNzI0NzAzMg) report.

### Qwen2.5-VL-3B

```bash
DATASET_NAME=LMMs-Lab-Turtle/Vision-SR1-47K \
bash scripts/train_vigos_qwen25_3b.sh
```

### Qwen2.5-VL-7B

```bash
DATASET_NAME=LMMs-Lab-Turtle/Vision-SR1-47K \
bash scripts/train_vigos_qwen25_7b.sh
```

### Useful Overrides

```bash
DATASET_NAME=LMMs-Lab-Turtle/Vision-SR1-47K \
MAX_STEPS=500 \
SAVE_STEPS=100 \
REPORT_TO=none \
bash scripts/train_vigos_qwen25_3b.sh
```

### Default Training Configuration

| Parameter | ViGOS-3B | ViGOS-7B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base model | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct` | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` |
| Epochs | 1 | 1 |
| GPUs/processes | 8 | 8 |
| Effective batch size | 32 | 32 |
| Per-device batch size | 2 | 1 |
| Gradient accumulation | 2 | 4 |
| Learning rate | `5e-6` | `5e-6` |
| Precision | bf16 | bf16 |
| Distributed training | ZeRO-2 | ZeRO-2 |
| Max prompt length | 32768 | 32768 |
| Max completion length | 4096 | 4096 |
| Rollout sampling | temp 1.1, top-p 0.95, top-k 20 | temp 1.1, top-p 0.95, top-k 20 |
| LoRA | r 64, alpha 128, dropout 0.05 | r 64, alpha 128, dropout 0.05 |
| Loss weights | `lambda_perception=1.0`, `lambda_reasoning=1.0`, `lambda_ref=2.0` | same |
| KL token clip | 0.05 | 0.05 |
| vLLM tensor parallel size | 1 | 2 |
| vLLM GPU memory utilization | 0.45 | 0.40 |

Training saves PEFT LoRA adapters under `runs/`. Merge an adapter into the base model before standalone evaluation:

```bash
uv run python scripts/merge_lora.py \
  --adapter runs/vigos_qwen25_3b_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/checkpoint-500 \
  --output runs/vigos_qwen25_3b_merged \
  --overwrite
```

If `--base-model` is omitted, the merge script reads `base_model_name_or_path` from the adapter config.

## Evaluation

Evaluation uses the ViGOS student prompt with assistant-side `<description>` prefill. The default wrapper uses vLLM for generation and an OpenAI-compatible judge when judging is enabled.

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key

MODEL_PATH=runs/vigos_qwen25_3b_merged \
bash scripts/eval_vigos.sh
```

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `PASS_K` | 5 |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | 8 generated candidates per vLLM call |
| `MAX_TOKENS` | 4096 |
| Sampling | temp 1.0, top-p 0.9, top-k 50 |
| Judge model | `deepseek-v4-flash` |
| Judge API URL | `https://api.deepseek.com` |
| Judge key env | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| Dataset suite | `mm-vet`, `mmmu_pro_10options`, `mmmu-pro-vision`, `MMMU`, `MMSI`, `mathverse`, `mathvista`, `realWorldQA` |
| Benchmark suite | `vilp-f`, `vilp-p` |

Include CV-Bench:

```bash
MODEL_PATH=runs/vigos_qwen25_3b_merged \
EVAL_BENCHMARKS=vilp-f,vilp-p,cv-bench \
bash scripts/eval_vigos.sh
```

Generate responses without judging:

```bash
MODEL_PATH=runs/vigos_qwen25_3b_merged \
SKIP_JUDGE=true \
bash scripts/eval_vigos.sh
```

Outputs are written under `eval_outputs/vigos_${RUN_ID}/`:

| Path | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `responses/*.jsonl` | Prompts, sampled responses, extracted answers. |
| `judgments/*.jsonl` | Compact judge records with pass@k and avg@k verdicts. |
| `benchmark_scores/*.json` | Benchmark-specific summaries. |
| `summary.json` | Run configuration and aggregate output paths. |

## Results

Pass@5 counts an example correct if any of five samples is correct. Avg@5 averages correctness across the five samples.
